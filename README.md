Never Forget What They Did
==========================

For years our politicians lied to us, made us broken promises, acted as they own us and misused the vote we gave them. They did all infront of us and didn't even make an attempt to act sorry for these actions. Again and again we forgot these acts and forgave them when the elections came. All because we FORGOT! 


Let's not forget what they did ever again. This is an attempt to record what each and every blunder our politicians did. So next time we can go through the their "profile" before casting our vote.
